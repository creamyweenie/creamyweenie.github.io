        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Welcome to my website! A lot of personal websites I see are tailored to 
        portray the creator with all their best achievments and accolades. I, unfortunately, 
        am not that successful to fill out an entire website. Nor do I have the articulation to fully portray 
        my personality wholistically. So here's my honest attempt with what I got!

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I am a southern California native, moving to Orange County around highschool age. Upon graduating in 2020, I attended the Univeristy of California, Irvine. I gotten bachelors 
            in Engineering Physics, Mathematics, and Economics in 2024. Now, I am pursing graduate school doing research in quantum optics, quantum engineering, and/or quantum computing. 
            Unless something atrocious happens, I am attending Boston Univeristy for my PhD starting Fall 2025. </p>

        <h2>Teaching and Mentoring</h2>
        <p>I believe one of the key characteristics that makes humans, well, humans is the conjunction of our ability to sympathize and communicate effectively.
        The ability to communicate scientific ideas effectively pushes the forefront of innovation and knowledge. 
        </p>
        <p>I came into univeristy wishing to become a highschool physics teacher. I, however, wanted to pursue even more education. I was a student teacher for a few quarters through the CalTeach program
            at UCI. That was around my first and second years of university. Around my third year, I became an undergraduate learning assistant, and became a lead learning assitant sometime after. 
            I was then hired as a learning and academic resource center tutor for UC, Irvine's LARC program. Instead of passively working under teaching assitants, I made lesson plans in this role. I wish to become a teaching assitant 
            in graduate school and will actively look into the possibility of becoming an instructor while still completing my doctorate. 
        </p>
        <p>I was also active as a mentor to incoming physics major at my alma matter. My work for the department lead me to be given the outstanding senior service award for the Physics Department. </p>
